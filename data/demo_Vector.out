Create array1, an empty Vector object with a default
storage capacity = 10, using the default constructor.

Demonstrating AddLast, a useful member function, which
adds a given item as the last item of the
sequence.

Add one after another the following four string objects
to array1 using the AddLast function. 
CS 590WS, Course Material, Using, Vectors.
Show the sequence of items in array1 using operator [].

Create array2, an empty Vector object
of a specified storage capacity, say 5.

set array2=array1.

Show and delete the last item of array 2 using 
ShowLast and RemoveLast functions.

Vectors

Show the number of items in array2 using NumberOfItems.

3

Remove all items in array2 using RemoveAll.

Show array2 is empty using IsEmpty.

array2 is empty.

reset array2 = array1.

Resize array2 so that its storage capacity = 2.
Thus array2 gets truncated retaining its
first 2 items only.

Show number of items in array2 using NumberOfItems.
